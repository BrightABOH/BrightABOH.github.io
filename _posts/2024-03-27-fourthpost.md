## Introduction
Remember the pain you go through working with very cloudy satellite images? Where lowering the cloud percentage would mean that you will have little or no images to work with? Moreso painful and frustrating when you build a very good deep-learning model only to realize that the inference component is extra challenging because the single image to predict with is almost always cloudy. This is even more prevalent when you are working with optical imageries such as Sentinel 2.

A recent project to develop a deep learning model to predict and estimate cropland area from freely available optical satellites further  highlighted the need to design a solution.  

In this blog post, I will share with you how to identify cloudy pixels and replace them with alternative satellite images.
Sentinel 2 has become such an indispensable choice when working on agriculture and other land  applications due to the following reasons and more: 

High Spatial Resolution 
Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution imagery, with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 meters to 60 meters, depending on the spectral band. This level of detail allows for the identification and monitoring of small-scale features such as individual fields, crops, and land cover types.

Multi-Spectral Bands
Sentinel-2 captures imagery across multiple spectral bands, including visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands. These bands are particularly useful for assessing vegetation health, crop stress, and land cover classification. The availability of these spectral bands enables a more comprehensive analysis of agricultural and land use dynamics

Frequent Coverage
The Sentinel-2 satellites revisit the same area on the Earth's surface every 5 days at the equator, providing frequent and regular coverage of agricultural regions. This rapid revisit time allows for the monitoring of temporal changes in vegetation growth, crop phenology, and land use patterns over time.
