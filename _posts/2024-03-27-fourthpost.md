## Introduction
HEYA! It has been a while, hope you miss me, I miss all of you. Back to focus, remember the pain you go through working with very cloudy satellite images? Where lowering the cloud percentage would mean that you will have little or no images to work with? Moreso painful and frustrating when you build a very good deep-learning model only to realize that the inference component is extra challenging because the single image to predict with is almost always cloudy. This is even more prevalent when you are working with optical imageries such as Sentinel 2.

A recent project to develop a deep learning model to predict and estimate cropland area from freely available optical satellites further  highlighted the need to design a solution.  



In this blogpost, I will share with you how to identify cloudy pixels and replace them with alternative satellite images.
Knowing how valuable the multi-spectral imagery band (Sentinel 2
