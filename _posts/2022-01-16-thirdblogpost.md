## Goal

## Introduction 
Harmattan is  a north eastern (wind direction is mainly north east) trade dry and dusty winds that blows from the south of the Sahara towards the Gulf of Guinea.  These trade winds are considered to be seasonal as they blow from November till March . 
With such dry winds, the relative humidity usually hovers around <10% , temperatures usually fluctuates a lot during this period with cold night temperatures ranging from 9-20 Celsius. During the day however, temperatures could go as high as 30-39 Celsius depending on the location ! 

### Harmattan haze
### Formation of harmattan haze and/or dust storm
### Effects of harmattan
### Other winds of Africa
## Data description

In this tutorial, we will use the Sentinel -5Precursor Near Real Time (NRTI) UltraViolet Aerosol Index (UVAI) also known as the Aerosol Absorbing Index(AAI). The Sentinel-5Precursor is  part of the sentinelâ€™s earth observation satellite mission launched by the European Space Agency collect remotely sensed atmospheric data mostly on air pollution

The AAI is defined as the difference between the ratio of measured reflectance at 354 and 388 nm and the ratio of simulated reflectances at these wavelength depending on the changes in Rayleigh wavelength scattering. 


Mathematically;

When the AAI is positive, it indicates the presence of UV-absorbing aerosols like dust and smoke. This index is useful for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks(such as harmattan), volcanic ash, etc.
