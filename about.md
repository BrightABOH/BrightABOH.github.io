Welcome to my website! I am a Ghanaian - I grew up in Ghana. My expertise lies in data analysis, data visualisation, statistical learning, and data engineering; however I am interested in a range of subjects that involve technical know-how and logical thinking. Further interests include deep learning, climate change , camping, endurance sports, and reading.
